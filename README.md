## Simple Photo Feed

Here you'll find the Simple Photo Feed application, which is a Rails application
that makes use of the Flickr API.

As long as you know a user's Flickr ID, input it into this application and you can
retrieve some of their latest photos that they've hosted on Flickr!

This project is done following The Odin Project, which this project in particular can
be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis).
