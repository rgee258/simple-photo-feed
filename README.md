## Simple Photo Feed

Here you'll find the Simple Photo Feed application, which is a Rails application
that makes use of the Flickr API.

As long as you know a user's Flickr ID, input it into this application and you can
retrieve ten of their most popular photos that they've uploaded onto Flickr!

# Usage Notes

This application relies on the Flickr API, make sure to set your environment
variables containing the appropriate API key values before usage. Documentation for
using the Flickr API and its corresponding usage in this application can be viewed 
[here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).

Input for retrieving popular photos from a Flickr user requires a user's ID which is
not easily accessible. You can get IDs for usage in this application using services
such as [idGettr](https://www.webfx.com/tools/idgettr/).
